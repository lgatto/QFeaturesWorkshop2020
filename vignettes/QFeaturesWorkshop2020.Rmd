## Introduction

**Learning Objectives** The goals of this workshop are to provide a
real-life example of step-by-step quantitative proteomics data
analysis using the `QFeatures` package.

Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics data can be
representated as a matrix of quantitative values for features (PSMs,
peptides, proteins) arranged along the rows, measured for a set of
samples, arranged along the columns. The is a common representation
for any quantitative data set. We will be using the
`SummarizedExperiment` class:

```{r sefig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Schematic representation of the anatomy if a `SummarizedExperiment` object. (Figure taken from the `SummarizedExperiment` package vignette.)"}
knitr::include_graphics("SE.svg")
```

- The sample (columns) metadata can be access with the `colData()`
  function.
- The features (rows) metadata can be access with the `rowData()`
  column.
- If the features represent ranges along genomic coordinates, these
  can be accessed with `rowRanges()`
- Additional metadata describing the overall experiment can be
  accessed with `metadata()`.
- The quantiative data can be accessed with `assay()`.
- `assays()` returns a list of matrix-like assays.

### QFeatures

While mass spectrometers acquire data for spectra/peptides, the
biological entity of interest are the protein. As part of the data
processing, we are thus required to **aggregate** low-level
quantitative features into higher level data.


```{r featuresplot, fig.cap = "Conceptual representation of a `QFeatures` object and the aggregative relation between different assays.", echo = FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(NA, xlim = c(0, 12), ylim = c(0, 20),
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "", bty = "n")

for (i in 0:7)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")


for (i in 8:12)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")

for (i in 13:18)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "orange", border = "white")

for (i in 19)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")


for (i in 5:7)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")

for (i in 8:10)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")

for (i in 11:13)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "orange", border = "white")

for (i in 14)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")

rect(9, 8, 12, 8+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")
rect(9, 9, 12, 9+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")
rect(9, 10, 12, 10+1, col = "orange", border = "white")
rect(9, 11, 12, 11+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")

segments(3, 8, 5, 8, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 6, 5, 7, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 4, 5, 6, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 0, 5, 5, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 10, 5, 9, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 11, 5, 10, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 13, 5, 11, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 14, 5, 12, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 16, 5, 13, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 19, 5, 14, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 20, 5, 15, lty = "dashed")


segments(8, 5, 9, 8, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 8, 9, 9, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 11, 9, 10, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 14, 9, 11, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 15, 9, 12, lty = "dashed")
```

We are going to start to familiarise ourselves with the `QFeatures`
class implemented in the
[`QFeatures`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/articles/QFeatures.html)
package. Let's start by loading the `tidyverse`, `limma` and
`QFeatures` packages.


```{r pkgs, message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")
library("QFeatures")
library("limma")
```
