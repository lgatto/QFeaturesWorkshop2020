**Learning Objectives** The goals of this workshop are to provide a
real-life example of step-by-step quantitative proteomics data
analysis using the `QFeatures` package. This vignette focuses on the
`QFeatures` infrastructure.

## Introduction

Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics data can be
representated as a matrix of quantitative values for features (PSMs,
peptides, proteins) arranged along the rows, measured for a set of
samples, arranged along the columns. The is a common representation
for any quantitative data set. We will be using the
`SummarizedExperiment` [@SE] class:

```{r sefig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Schematic representation of the anatomy of a `SummarizedExperiment` object. (Figure taken from the `SummarizedExperiment` package vignette.)"}
knitr::include_graphics("SE.svg")
```

- The sample (columns) metadata can be access with the `colData()`
  function.
- The features (rows) metadata can be access with the `rowData()`
  column.
- If the features represent ranges along genomic coordinates, these
  can be accessed with `rowRanges()`
- Additional metadata describing the overall experiment can be
  accessed with `metadata()`.
- The quantiative data can be accessed with `assay()`.
- `assays()` returns a list of matrix-like assays.

## QFeatures

While mass spectrometers acquire data for spectra/peptides, the
biological entity of interest are the protein. As part of the data
processing, we are thus required to **aggregate** low-level
quantitative features into higher level data.


```{r featuresplot, fig.cap = "Conceptual representation of a `QFeatures` object and the aggregative relation between different assays.", echo = FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(NA, xlim = c(0, 12), ylim = c(0, 20),
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "", bty = "n")

for (i in 0:7)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")


for (i in 8:12)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")

for (i in 13:18)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "orange", border = "white")

for (i in 19)
    rect(0, i, 3, i+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")


for (i in 5:7)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")

for (i in 8:10)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")

for (i in 11:13)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "orange", border = "white")

for (i in 14)
    rect(5, i, 8, i+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")

rect(9, 8, 12, 8+1, col = "lightgrey", border = "white")
rect(9, 9, 12, 9+1, col = "steelblue", border = "white")
rect(9, 10, 12, 10+1, col = "orange", border = "white")
rect(9, 11, 12, 11+1, col = "darkgrey", border = "white")

segments(3, 8, 5, 8, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 6, 5, 7, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 4, 5, 6, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 0, 5, 5, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 10, 5, 9, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 11, 5, 10, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 13, 5, 11, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 14, 5, 12, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 16, 5, 13, lty = "dashed")
segments(3, 19, 5, 14, lty = "dashed")

segments(3, 20, 5, 15, lty = "dashed")


segments(8, 5, 9, 8, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 8, 9, 9, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 11, 9, 10, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 14, 9, 11, lty = "dashed")
segments(8, 15, 9, 12, lty = "dashed")
```

We are going to start to familiarise ourselves with the `QFeatures`
class implemented in the
[`QFeatures`](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/articles/QFeatures.html)
package. The class is derived from the Bioconductor
`MultiAssayExperiment` [@MAE] class. Let's start by loading the
`QFeatures` package.


```{r pkgs, message = FALSE}
library("QFeatures")
```

Next, we load the `feat1` test data, which is composed of single
*assay* of class `SummarizedExperiment` composed of 10 rows and 2
columns.

```{r load_feat1}
data(feat1)
feat1
```

Let's perform some simple operations to familiarise ourselves with the
`QFeatures` class:

- Extract the sample metadata using the `colData()` accessor (like you
  have previously done with `SummarizedExperiment` objects).

```{r cd}
colData(feat1)
```

- Extract the first (and only) assay composing this `QFeaures` data
  using the `[[` operator (as you have done to extract elements of a
  list) by using the assay's index or name.

```{r assay1}
feat1[[1]]
feat1[["psms"]]
```

- Extract the `psms` assay's row data and quantitative values.

```{r rd}
assay(feat1[[1]])
rowData(feat1[[1]])
```

## Feature aggregation


The central functionality of the `QFeatures` infrastructure is the
aggregation of features into higher-level features while retaining the
link between the different levels. This can be done with the
[`aggregateFeatures()` function](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/reference/QFeatures-aggregate.html).

The call below will

- operate on the `psms` assay of the `feat1` objects;
- aggregate the rows the assay following the grouping defined in the
  `peptides` row data variables;
- perform aggregation using the `colMeans()` function;
- create a new assay named `peptides` and add it to the `feat1`
  object.

```{r agg1}
feat1 <- aggregateFeatures(feat1, i = "psms",
                           fcol = "Sequence",
                           name = "peptides",
                           fun = colMeans)
feat1
```

- Let's convince yourself that we understand the effect of feature
  aggregation and repeat the calculations manually and check the
  content of the new assay's row data.

```{r cm}
## SYGFNAAR
colMeans(assay(feat1[[1]])[1:3, ])
assay(feat1[[2]])["SYGFNAAR", ]

## ELGNDAYK
colMeans(assay(feat1[[1]])[4:6, ])
assay(feat1[[2]])["ELGNDAYK", ]

## IAEESNFPFIK
colMeans(assay(feat1[[1]])[7:10, ])
assay(feat1[[2]])["IAEESNFPFIK", ]
```

```{r rd2}
rowData(feat1[[2]])
```


We can now aggregate the peptide-level data into a new protein-level
assay using the `colMedians()` aggregation function.

```{r agg2}
feat1 <- aggregateFeatures(feat1, i = "peptides",
                           fcol = "Protein",
                           name = "proteins",
                           fun = colMedians)
feat1
assay(feat1[["proteins"]])
```


## Subsetting and filtering

The link between the assays becomes apparent when we now subset the
assays for protein A as shown below or using the `subsetByFeature()`
function. This creates a new instance of class `QFeatures` containing
assays with the expression data for protein, its peptides and their
PSMs.

```{r prota}
feat1["ProtA", , ]
```


The `filterFeatures()` function can be used to filter rows the assays
composing a `QFeatures` object using the row data variables. We can
for example retain rows that have a `pval` < 0.05, which would only
keep rows in the `psms` assay because the `pval` is only relevant for
that assay.

```{r ff1}
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ pval < 0.05)
```

On the other hand, if we filter assay rows for those that localise to
the mitochondrion, we retain the relevant protein, peptides and PSMs.

```{r ff2}
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ location == "Mitochondrion")
```

As an exercise, let's filter rows that do not localise to the
mitochondrion.


```{r ff3}
filterFeatures(feat1, ~ location != "Mitochondrion")
```

data*](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/articles/QFeatures.html)
vignette and the `QFeature` [manual
page](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/reference/QFeatures-class.html)
