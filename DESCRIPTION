Description: The QFeatures package provides infrastructure (that is
   classes to store data and the methods to process and manipulate
   them) to manage and analyse quantitative features from mass
   spectrometry experiments. It is based on the SummarizedExperiment
   and MultiAssayExperiment Bioconductor classes. Assays in a QFeatures
   object have a hierarchical relation: proteins are composed of
   peptides, themselves produced by spectra. Throughout the aggregation
   and processing of these data, the relations between assays are tracked
   and recorded, thus allowing users to easily navigate across spectra,
   peptide and protein quantitative data. In this workshop, we will
   demonstrate how to import data as QFeatures objects, how to process
   and analyse data in QFeatures objects, and how to interpret the results.
   Some familiarity with Bioconductor data analysis, in particular the
   SummarizedExperiment class, is recommended to follow this short workshop.
